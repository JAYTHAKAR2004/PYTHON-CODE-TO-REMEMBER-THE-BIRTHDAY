🎉 Birthday Reminder 🎂


This Python script helps you remember birthdays 🎈 by storing names and their corresponding birth dates! It checks if today's date matches any birthday in the log and shows a celebratory message with the person's age 🥳.

✨ Features


📅 Interactive birthday addition: Easily add new birthdays using the console.

🎂 Birthday match check: Automatically calculates and displays a birthday message if the current date matches a birthday in the log.

🎉 Age calculation: Shows the birthday person's age along with an ordinal suffix (e.g., 1st, 2nd, 3rd).

🚀 How It Works

The script initializes a pre-stored list of birthdays in the format (Name, (YYYY, MM, DD)).

It checks if today's date matches any of the birthdays.

If there's a match, the script calculates the person's age and displays a fun birthday message with their name and age 🎈.

You can add new birthdays interactively, which are appended to the list for future reference 🎁.


🖥️ Example Output

When it's someone's birthday, the script shows:

🎉 It's Jay's 20th Birthday 🎂

If you'd like to add a new birthday, you'll see:

To add birthday type y:

Whose bday?
